# LCE-SAEA
In real-world optimization problems, there is a significant difference in function evaluation time between 
objectives, and these problems are defined as the problems with heterogeneous objectives. To utilize the 
latency of objectives, we propose a local correlation estimation based surrogate-assisted bi-objective 
evolutionary algorithm for problems with heterogeneous objectives. In the proposed algorithm, surrogate 
models are employed to approximate the objective functions. The proposed local correlation estimation (LCE)
method is used to analyze the correlation between objectives within a local region, guiding the search 
direction for one objective while identifying promising solutions for the other objective.
